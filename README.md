# My_Fitness-Tracker

I started walking to get fit, but consistency was a problem. Then, a friend suggested using a Power BI dashboard with my walking data from Samsung Health. It made tracking my progress fun and helped me stay on track.

This project was born out of my personal fitness goals. I am still a work in progress in my fitness journey and I am happy with my progress

Tools used: Google Sheets, Power BI, T-SQL, Dataflow Gen2, and Data Factory.
